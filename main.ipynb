    "## List of General Recommendation Models in RecBole\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is a summary of the key recommendation models available in the RecBole framework, which are well-suited for general recommendation tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **MF (Matrix Factorization)**: A foundational model using latent factors to capture the interactions between users and items.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **BPR (Bayesian Personalized Ranking)**: Optimizes a pairwise ranking loss, ideal for datasets with implicit feedback.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **NeuMF (Neural Matrix Factorization)**: Combines classical matrix factorization with deep neural networks to enhance interaction modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **SVD++**: Extends SVD to incorporate implicit feedback alongside explicit ratings, improving prediction accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **FM (Factorization Machines)**: Models interactions between any two variables in sparse datasets, useful for capturing complex patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **NMF (Non-negative Matrix Factorization)**: Focuses on decomposing the input matrix into non-negative factors, often used for recommendations where the data inputs (like ratings) are non-negative.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **AutoRec**: Employs an autoencoder to learn latent structures of user preferences or item characteristics, useful for dense prediction tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **LightGCN**: Simplifies the Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) approach by removing feature transformations and non-linearities, enhancing scalability and performance in recommendation scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **ItemKNN and UserKNN**: Traditional collaborative filtering algorithms that recommend based on nearest neighbors, suitable for scenarios where simple but effective recommendations are needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **DeepFM**: Integrates the linear model of factorization machines with the feature representation learning capability of deep neural networks, offering a powerful model for complex and large-scale recommendation tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "These models cover a wide range of recommendation techniques from matrix factorization to deep learning and provide robust tools for addressing diverse recommendation scenarios."
